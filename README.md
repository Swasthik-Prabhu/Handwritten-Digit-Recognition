# Handwritten Digit Recognition using MNIST Dataset

This project implements a machine learning model to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using TensorFlow and Keras. The goal is to build a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for digit classification, which can classify digits from 0 to 9.

## Project Overview

The MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9) for training and 10,000 images for testing. The task is to train a model to recognize the digits from these images. We will use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to achieve this.
